# Phase 1 — Discovery Plan & Interview Guide  
**Project:** Mirror — Outreach Research on Student Eating Disorder Recovery  
**Owner:** Siwoo Yoon (Outreach & Insights Lead, Mirror Startup)  
**Date:** (Insert today’s date)

---

## Objectives
1. Understand how **students** and **medical professionals** perceive eating disorder recovery support systems.  
2. Identify **barriers to access** and **desired app features** that would make Mirror valuable for universities and students.  
3. Align survey and interview insights with **evidence-based research** (PubMed, IBISWorld).  
4. Deliver clear, actionable insights to guide Mirror’s product and UX teams.

---

## Research Questions
- What prevents students from accessing traditional eating disorder care?  
- What features would make a digital app feel safe, inclusive, and effective?  
- How do clinicians view app-based recovery tools, and what data would they find credible?  
- Which **behavior change techniques (BCTs)**—goal setting, reminders, feedback—resonate most with users?

---

## Methods
- **Data Source:** Existing Google Form survey responses from medical professionals and students (CSV format).  
- **Approach:**  
  - Thematic coding of open-ended responses (qualitative analysis).  
  - Frequency analysis of multiple-choice questions (quantitative patterns).  
  - Evidence mapping to PubMed research on peer support, CBT-based interventions, and app-based outcomes.  
- **Optional Interviews:**  
  - 10–15 minute Zoom or in-person follow-ups with selected students and clinicians (voluntary, anonymous).

## 🗣️ Interview & Survey Questions
### For Students
1. What makes it hard to ask for help or use campus recovery services?  
2. What would make you trust and regularly use an app like Mirror?  
3. What type of community or peer space would make you feel supported?  
4. Which tools (tracking, journaling, reminders) would help you most in recovery?  
5. What would make the app feel *safe*, *nonjudgmental*, and *inclusive*?

### For Medical Professionals
1. What digital tools or apps do you currently recommend for ED recovery?  
2. What features would make Mirror’s app clinically useful or trustworthy?  
3. How should Mirror approach moderation and safety in peer-led groups?  
4. What outcomes or data would you want to see to support Mirror’s credibility?  
5. How could Mirror best complement (not replace) in-person treatment?

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and anonymized dataset (Phase 1 output)  
- Thematic summary (top 5 recurring feature needs or pain points)  
- Insight visuals for stakeholder readout  
- Recommendations document for product & UX teams (Phase 2 handoff)

---

## ⚖️ Ethical & Privacy Considerations
- All responses de-identified (no emails or names used).  
- Participants informed of voluntary and anonymous participation.  
- Stored data limited to internal analysis and deleted after project completion.  
- Findings describe group-level insights, not individual experiences.

---

## Next Step (Phase 2)
- Create user **personas** and **journey maps** using these insights.  
- Translate findings into prioritized features and UX recommendations for the first Mirror prototype.
