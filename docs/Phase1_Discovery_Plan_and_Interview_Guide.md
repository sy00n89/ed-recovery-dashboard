# Discovery Plan & Interview Guide (Phase 1)
**Project:** Redefining Recovery Systems for Eating Disorders  
**Owner:** Reese Yoon  
**Date:** November 06, 2025

## Objectives
1. Understand stakeholder goals, constraints, and definitions of success.  
2. Identify user needs, barriers, and opportunities across the recovery journey.  
3. Validate feasibility and privacy constraints of current data.

## Methods
- 30–45 min semi-structured interviews (students, clinicians, admin)
- Data audit of current CSVs
- Artifact review (existing surveys, forms)

## Interview Questions (Examples)
### Students
- Walk me through how you currently seek help—what helps, what gets in the way?
- What would make you feel safe and supported using a campus app?
- Which features would you actually use weekly?

### Clinicians
- What information would help you triage or support students better?
- Where do you spend time manually processing feedback today?
- What would make an analytics dashboard meaningfully useful?

### Admin/IT
- Which metrics matter most for planning and reporting?
- What is acceptable risk for data handling?
- How should access control be managed (roles, audit)?

## Outputs
- Notes + themes (affinity mapping)
- Personas (Student, Clinician, Admin)
- Journey maps (Awareness → Access → Support → Follow-up)
- Prioritized opportunities → Requirements Backlog
